## Description
This is a self-built app in Next.js. I started with a HTML/CSS project challenge from Frontend Mentor. In order to make the content dynamic I converted to Next.js and I implemented a headless CMS. This way the user can fill in their own content. I'm currently working on adding a typing game to show I can work with interactions and state.
